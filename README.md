In this file we will use different regression models on different data set to predict the outcome. To understand the regression algorithm here are some basic terms. 

**Correlation**:
It is the measure of association between two variables, The value of correlation coefficient varies between -1 and 1. -1 means that they are inversely related, and they have perfect negative correlation and +1 indicates that they have perfecr postive correlation. 
Zero Indicates that they have no relationship. 

**Regression**:
a) Simple Regression:It is used to determine the relation between one dependent variable and one independent variable.
the regression line also known as least square line is the plot of expected values of dependent variable for all value of the independent variable. 
equation is Y = mx + c + e
Y = Dependent variable 
x = Independent variable 
m = slope of regression line 
c = y intercept 
e = error term.
